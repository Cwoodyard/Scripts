# Scripts
Just a batch of scripts to make my life easier 

  # fetch-discord.sh
 - An easy linux util for non-debian based installs to auto update discord when its out of date. I also added some support for the installers of BetterDiscord and Vencord for some personal taste!
   ## Features
    - -v flag for verbose installs to troubleshoot problems  
    - Betterdiscord and Vencord support for quick patching or installing if needed.
